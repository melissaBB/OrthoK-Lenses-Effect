## Research Topic

An Investigation into the Correlation Between Myopia Patients' **Initial Treatment Ages** and the **Percent Improvement in Spherical Equivalence (%)** after 1 Year of Wearing Orthokeratology Lenses, as Calculated by Spherical Power (diopter, D) and Cylinder Power (D).

## Summary

In recent years, myopia has become a more and more common problem among children. It is also predicted that, by 2050, around 5 billion people will have myopia (Dolgin, 2015).

Raw data used in this investigation is publicly available on NCBI ([Yin et al., 2019](https://www.ncbi9.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6545229/#supplemental-information)). Using the column of **age**, spherical diopter (**SPH**) and cylinder diopter (**CYL**), a new raw data table is generated. The initial, final and change in SE (D) and the percent and average percent improvement of **SE (%)** for each age group are calculated, respectively.

In simple terms, SPH is the power of a lens, while CYL is the power of astigmatism (Mayo Clinic, 2019), they are considered direct measurements of one's vision (Heiting, 2020). Another value, spherical equivalent (SE), as measured in diopters (D), is a comprehensive measurement of SPH and CYL, that is used to prescribe contact lenses to an individual with low astigmatism.

Using visual examination and Pearson's correlation coefficient test, there is a moderate positive correlation between **patients' initial treatment age** and **SE's average percent improvement(%)**. However, since r-value is less than the critical value, meaning that such relationship is not statistically significant.
