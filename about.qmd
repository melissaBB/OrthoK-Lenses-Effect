## About this Project

I started wearing OrthoK lenses since grade 5, and continued wearing it until today. OrthoK lenses has had its up-and-downs in the industry, with some researchers criticizing its permanent harm to the cornea, while others look at its ability to slow down the accelerating eye power increase. Now this is almost my 10th year wearing OrthoK lenses, and I want to know if there's a correlation between the age of a patient when they first received the treatment and their outcome in a year. 

## Appreciation
